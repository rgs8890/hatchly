# hatchly
www.hatchly.com -> Mentoring Business

This is my first initial project, but it is aimed to actually scale into a SAAS start-up. It is primarily used for:
- One on One Tech Mentoring (Breaking into Tech)
- Resource Hub
- AI Enablement Services
- Internships (Paid)
- Internships (Unpaid)
- How to get started in tech? (VsCode, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebooks) - JavaScript 
- Bootcamps
- Visa Sponsorship Guidance

The Navigation Bar will have:
- Home
- How to get started?
- AI Tools
- Internships
- Courses (Codefinity, Codeacademy, FreecodeCamp)
- Learning Pathways (C#, C++, C)
- Blogreel -> Linkedin Latest Posts
- Mentoring
- About
- Contact

This can be used as a platform to help people break into tech/ have all the resources at university to start building on their linkedin.
